The first plot shows the correlation between the rising time of the Triggering channel (Channel_0) and the passive channel (channel_14). There is a strong correlation between the two. The line at the bottom corrsponds to events which peah value did not exceed 200. The value 200 was chosen randomly.

After applying a filter to only show valid rising edge times the plot looks like this:

Also, the peak value times are correlated but due to the saturation of the pre-amplifier the correlation is less pronounced.
